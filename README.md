Repo for submission to STAT 301-3 Classification Competition

# file organization
Folders `set_1` and `set_2` contain model setup files and tuning scripts for two sets of recipes for the kaggle competition. The random forest models from each of these sets were the final submissions for the kaggle competition. Each folder also contains a `kaggle_submission` folder that contains the predictions that were submitted to the kaggle competition.
